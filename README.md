# Gimli

After the in-office bootcamp, where we examined the .NET world and MVC approach deeply, I developed this project using the knowledge we gained about the 4 pillars of OOP and SOLID principles. Each cloth added in this project can exist independently in the database. When you want to create a new outfit, you can choose clothes from defined clothes according to body parts. When you type the name of your outfit in the search box on the homepage, the clothes you choose are shown to you. You can update or delete the outfit or cloth you have chosen.
